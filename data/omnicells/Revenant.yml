passive: >
  Lifesteal +2%. When Revenant state ends, each stack of Void Energy grants 115
  health per second for 10 seconds.
active: >
  Drain up to 500 health to enter Revenant state and spawn a Void Orb. For every
  100 health drained, summon an Umbral Tendril that deals 700 umbral damage. If
  an Umbral Tendril hits a target, it spawns an additional Void Orb upon impact.
  Picking up a Void Orb grants a stack of Void Energy, which gives +4% damage
  and extends Revenant state by 1 second. Revenant state lasts for 15 seconds
  and prevents all healing.
