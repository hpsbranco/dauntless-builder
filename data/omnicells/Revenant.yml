  Lifesteal +{{percentLifesteal}}%. When Revenant state ends, each stack of Void
  Energy grants {{health}} health per second for {{healthTime}} seconds.
active: >-
  Drain up to {{healthDrain}} health to enter Revenant state and spawn a Void Orb.
  For every {{drainedHealth}} health drained, summon an Umbral Tendril that deals
  {{umbralDamage}} umbral damage. If an Umbral Tendril hits a target, it spawns an
  additional Void Orb upon impact. Picking up a Void Orb grants a stack of Void Energy, 
  which gives +{{percentDamage}}% damage and extends Revenant state by {{revenantDurationExtend}} 
  second. Revenant state lasts for {{revenantTime}} seconds and prevents all healing.
