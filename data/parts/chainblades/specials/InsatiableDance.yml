    Push off a nearby target with invulnerability, then use primary or secondary attacks to perform a followup. Primary:
    A dash attack to the target that consumes 1 momentum. Secondary: A spinning slam that consumes all momentum to heal
    you and create a 150 healing orb for each momentum consumed. Targets at or healed to full health gain 5% damage for
    10 seconds, stacking up to 4 times. (Consume 1 momentum if no follow up is performed.)
