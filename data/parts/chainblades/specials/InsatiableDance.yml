    Push off a nearby target with invulnerability, then use primary or secondary
    attacks to perform a followup. Primary: A dash attack to the target that
    consumes {{momentum}} momentum. Secondary: A spinning slam that consumes all momentum
    to heal you and create a {{heal}} healing orb for each momentum consumed. Targets
    at or healed to full health gain {{damage}}% damage for {{damageTime}} seconds, stacking up to {{damageStack}}
    times. (Consume {{momentumIfNoFollow}} momentum if no follow up is performed.)
