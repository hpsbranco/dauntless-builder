    Push off a nearby target with invulnerability, then use primary or secondary
    attacks to perform a followup. Primary: A dash attack to the target that
    consumes 1 momentum. Secondary: A spinning slam that consumes all momentum
    to heal you and create a 150 healing orb for each momentum consumed. Targets
    at or healed to full health gain 5% damage for 10 seconds, stacking up to 4
    times. (Consume 1 momentum if no follow up is performed.)
