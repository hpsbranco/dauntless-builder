    Teleport forward with invulnerability and strike the nearest Behemoth part, dealing 75 damage and applying a mark
    that deals 25 damage per second for 7 seconds. When a mark expires, it deals 200 damage for each other mark active
    at the time. Mark duration increased to 10 seconds if an attack is avoided during the teleport.
